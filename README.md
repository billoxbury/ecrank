# Predicting the rank of an elliptic curve

Jupyter notebooks to explore and reproduce some of the results from [1]. See blog post [Predicting the rank of an elliptic curve](https://billoxbury.github.io/artificial_intelligence/zombie-bots-and-neural-bots/).

The notebooks are:

1. LMFDB. Playing with elliptic curves using Sage. Reproduce the murmurations plot.
2. Data frame. Create in Pandas and write to CSV file.
3. Prime series. Discussion of the a_i behaviours.
4. t-SNE and PCA. Introduce the b_i variables.
5. Models. Use TensorFlow to fit and compare models.
6. Conductors. Explore (inconclusively) prime facotrisation of the conductor as additional features.
